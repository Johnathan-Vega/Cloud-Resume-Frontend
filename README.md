# Cloud-Resume
This is the frontend contents of my cloud resume website, based on the Cloud Resume Challenge originally developed by Forrest Brazeal. The purpose of this project was to expose myself to services and tools that I felt like I needed more experience with.

This project touches of multiple AWS services with the opportunity to use 3rd party tools to simulate a development lifecycle that emulates a product an organization may wish to deploy. I am working on a full blog post which outlines the services and tools I used in this project. Overall, the experience was helpful and exciting. More information to come.
